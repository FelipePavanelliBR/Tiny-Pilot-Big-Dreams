In exploring a platform game in the tiny-scale universe, I realized that I would need to be quite inventive to make the parkour run more interesting and engaging. In doing so, I came up with 4 main game mechanics:

1) Moving platforms and animation triggers; mainly to allow the robot character to interact with the environment and explore more vertical spaces;
2) Score system for the battery and paper items, with responsive UI that updates both when first “receiving”, and last “returning” those items.
3) Paper airplane model that attaches the player as a child and provides controls for the final gameplay scene;
4) Blasting fan mechanic that works like a super jump pad, returning the player to the top main shelf;
